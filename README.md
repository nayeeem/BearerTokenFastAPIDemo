#### Fast API Security

> A Bearer Token is a security token used to authenticate and authorize requests in digital systems. It is a string of characters, often generated by a server, that grants access to protected resources when presented by the client. The term "bearer" signifies that possession of the token is sufficient to gain access, without requiring additional proof of identity.

> Bearer Tokens are stateless, meaning the server does not store them. Instead, they are self-contained, often in the form of JSON Web Tokens (JWTs), or validated cryptographically. They are typically short-lived, expiring within minutes or hours to minimize security risks if compromised. Integration is straightforward, as the token is simply attached to requests, usually in the HTTP Authorization header.

Request Header:
Authorization: Bearer <token>

#### How Bearer Tokens Work:

> Token Issuance: The client authenticates with an authorization server (e.g., using OAuth 2.0) and receives a token.

> Token Usage: The client includes the token in subsequent API requests, typically in the Authorization header.

> Server Validation: The server validates the token by checking its signature, expiration, and other claims (for JWTs) or by querying a database (for opaque tokens).

#### Use Cases:

# Bearer Tokens are widely used in modern applications, including:

> API Authentication: Securing RESTful APIs for services like GitHub or Stripe.

> Single-Page Applications (SPAs): Authenticating API calls without reloading the page.

> Microservices Communication: Enabling secure interactions between services.

> OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect: Facilitating delegated access, such as "Sign in with Google."

#### Bearer Tokens vs. JWTs

> While JWTs (JSON Web Tokens) are a common format for Bearer Tokens, they are not synonymous. A JWT is a structured token containing encoded data (header, payload, signature), 

> whereas a Bearer Token is a broader concept that can include opaque tokens (random strings with no embedded data).

#### Security Best Practices:

> Always use HTTPS to prevent token interception.

> Store tokens securely (e.g., avoid localStorage in browsers; use secure cookies).

> Set short expiration times and use refresh tokens for reauthentication.

> Validate tokens thoroughly, checking claims like expiration (exp) and issuer (iss).

> Avoid exposing tokens in URLs to prevent logging or caching vulnerabilities.

> Bearer Tokens are a cornerstone of modern authentication, offering a balance of simplicity and security when implemented with best practices.
